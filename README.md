### Hello! My name is Callen, and I like:
 - Art
 - Coding
 - Games
 - Food
 - And more!

I currently am extremely demotivated, so thank you to anyone who might try to help out on that.

I know quite a few languages! For e.g.,
I know everything of these: Scratch (All versions), HTML, CSS
And I know parts of these: JS, C, C#, and C++

If you want me to start projects such as DiamondOS (mine on Scratch) or GalacticOS (also mine on scratch), then make sure to follow me here and on Scratch! Anyways, bye!

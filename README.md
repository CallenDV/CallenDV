# Ello, I'm CheeseDev! Take a look at sum stuff about me.


## Where my Passion for Coding Started

It all started with me and my brother, Logan- on the family computer, him doing some computer related stuff. I couldn't mind but watch him, as he did this stuff that I had never seen before. I kinda just sat there. Once he left, I had gotten on the computer, seeing what this was. "Scratch". Interesting. Well, rather than using it, though, I read a bit on what it was, something called programming. Nice! But, rather than starting my coding career with that, it actually started with higher level programs like C! I watched and learned through videos on the Internet, and some articles, too. Interestingly, though, I actually started to go to lower languages as time went on, from C and programs like that to things like JS and HTML, and it was only until then I started using Scratch. I started making interactive Operating Systems, and then some games too, and then added animations on the side (I never really went through with it, though).

## Where I'm at now

Now, I've returned to the higher languages, like C and JS, to code in regularly. I still do occasionally make Scratch projects, among other things. Neat, right?

## My Goals

Right now, my current goal is to learn more languages, like Ruby, Rust, and also start trying out mobile apps. I am also trying to learn and improve on my current art styles, with my (much better artist) brother, Logan. 

## Some of my hobbies

I enjoy most things a lot of people enjoy, so there isn't much to see here. 
 * Art
 * Games
 * Coding
 * Video Production
 * And a lot of other things I don't have the time to list.

## My Experience

I am experienced with many programming languages, such as some ones you probably already know, like HTML5, JS, and CSS. I am also experienced with other ones, like Batch, and some others.

## Some of the Projects I helped make or make on my own

Some of these names include things you might or might not be familiar with, I don't know. Anyways, here you go:
 * DiamondOS2
 * DOSTV2
 * PrizVideo
 * Prizmarine (gone, now- it was a good run!)
 * Mayzer
 * Some others
